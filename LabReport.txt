Ran into math computation errors
Experimented with changing binary classification values and feature values
Created Lab Notebook and Presentation outline

Faryal:
12/16/20  ~ 2 hours
Refining and testing code for Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes labs 
Looked into data sets and pros and cons of each algorithm 
12/17/20 ~4.5 hours
Implemented Logistic Regression using lab code on data set
Implemented and ran into problems using Naive Bayes code, tried to change util file to parse csv
Research about sklearn and pandas implementation of Naive Bayes and implemented this instead
Fixed some hardcoding issues in Naive Bayes code, made edits to readme and merged code
